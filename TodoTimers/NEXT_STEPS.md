## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Current Issues
1. **Watch App Shell:** Currently shows placeholder "Hello, world!" content
2. **Test Verification:** Tests added to project but not yet run
3. **No Notifications:** Timer completion requires app to be open
4. **No Background Support:** Timers pause when app backgrounded

### Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)
- [ ] iCloud sync (replace Watch Connectivity for multi-device sync)
- [ ] Widget support (iOS Lock Screen and Home Screen)
- [ ] Apple Watch complications
- [ ] Siri shortcuts integration
- [ ] Timer templates and presets
- [ ] Timer history and analytics
- [ ] Export/import timer configurations
- [ ] Collaborative timers (share with other users)
- [ ] Apple Watch standalone mode (no iPhone required)

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting New Features
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/watch-app-views`
2. Review relevant tests and documentation
3. Plan implementation in markdown (optional)

### During Development
1. Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
2. Implement feature incrementally
3. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
4. Run tests after each major change

### Before Committing
1. Run full test suite: ⌘U
2. Check for build warnings
3. Review changes with `git diff`
4. Write clear commit message

### Merge to Main
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update README if needed
3. Create pull request (if working with team)
4. Merge and push to remote

## Questions and Decisions Needed

1. **Watch App Design:** Should Watch app support standalone mode (without iPhone)?
2. **Notification Strategy:** Use local notifications only, or also support remote notifications?
3. **iCloud Sync:** Add iCloud sync now or defer to post-launch?
4. **Monetization:** Free app, paid app, or freemium model?
5. **Target Devices:** Support older iOS/watchOS versions or latest only?
